# Holberton School - Low Level Programming

This repository contains my solutions to various programming projects and exercises in low-level programming. The projects are part of the curriculum at Holberton School, where I am learning the foundations of computer science and software development.

## Contents

Each project or exercise is organized into its own directory and contains the necessary files to complete the task. The repository is structured as follows:

- **[0x00-hello_world](./0x00-hello_world)**: Introduction to C programming and the compilation process.
- **[0x01-variables_if_else_while](./0x01-variables_if_else_while)**: Working with variables, conditional statements, and loops.
- **[0x02-functions_nested_loops](./0x02-functions_nested_loops)**: Introduction to functions and nested loop structures.
- **[0x03-debugging](./0x03-debugging)**: Debugging C programs and fixing common issues.
- **[0x04-more_functions_nested_loops](./0x04-more_functions_nested_loops)**: Further practice with functions and nested loops.

Feel free to explore each directory to find the specific project or exercise you're interested in.
